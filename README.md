# 🍪 The Cookie Eater

- [How to run it](docs/how-to-run.md)

## ⚠️ The problem 

We are tired of having to deal with every cookie banner on every website we 
visit and always having to reject them to continue browsing.
Every. Single. Time.

## ✨ The solution 

We then decided to create "the cookie eater" your friendly, and efficient, 
Chrome extension that would solve all of your cookie problems.

## 🧩 Extendability (Soon to come!)

The core concept for `The Cooke Eater` is that we created it to be extendable.
Inside the `/recepies` directory, you will find several `JSON` files that 
contain the `secret sauce` for the application to be able to remove the banners
from **virtually** any website you want!

All you have to do is to use the `template.recipe.json`, fill in the data,
rename it to the website that you want to remove banners from, and the 
extension should be able to start removing them immediately.

All `The Cookie Eater` needs is that you give it the recipe, and he'll take
care of it.

Our goal is that, with the help of your contribution and your `PR`, 
`The Cookie Eater` will get smarter and better. 🙂
