We hope to be able to ship this to the Chrome Web Store soon, but for now,
the simplest way to use this extension is by following the steps below:

1. Clone this repo locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LewisDamy/the-cookie-eater.git
    ```

2. Open your Chrome browser and go to the following url:

    ```bash
    chrome://extensions/
    ```

3. Enable the Dev mode:

4. Load the extension by clicking the button and selecting the directory
   of the project on your computer:
